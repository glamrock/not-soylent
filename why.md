#Liquid Sustenance
(May 2, 2015)

Lately, I’ve been contemplating replacing some or all of my meals with a liquid meal-replacement drink.  Not Soylent, the trendy VC-backed beige meal solution, but a solution from [Custom Body Fuel](custombodyfuel.com/product/keto-fuel/) that has a different composition.  Today I took the plunge and ordered two weeks’ worth of liquid sustenance   There are a few reasons for this:

While I feel much better on a ketogenic diet, in practice it is hard to maintain just due to the prep work and cost required. When your diet comprises mostly of a large amount of oils, meats, and vegetables, the costs go up very quickly.  I also found that (again, in practice) keto required a fair bit of time for prep-work, which had to happen consistently around every meal.  My schedule is kind of all over the place, and while I might have time on Sunday to prep half the meals for the week, I might not have any time during most of those days to prepare vegetables or the rest of the meals.  And because there winds up being a lot of protein and fat, it typically needs to be divided into 3+ meals a day.  The combination of factors just makes it very difficult to manage.

It’s a real shame because I do feel much better when doing keto.  My brain is less foggy, I code faster, I have way more energy, my depression is lessened, and my energy levels are consistent throughout the day.  

There’s another reason why I’m doing this *now* -- stress and depression. For the past couple of months, I just really haven’t been taking joy in preparing or eating food.  In practice, this means that my eating is *actually worse* than it usually is.  Because I don’t want to eat, I frequently skip meals -- leading to crabbiness. Recognizing that I fucking *have to eat* if I want to be tolerable and get things done, I’ve been making myself eat at least one meal a day most days.  But because I also no longer receive joy from preparing food, this leads to ordering out a lot.  

**So my eating habits right now are dramatically more expensive, time-consuming, and far less healthy than they should be.  The trifecta.**  And it’s not like I’m getting anything out of the extra cost.  Some might say that skipping meals is ideal, given that I’m a fatty.  But that’s ignoring the context in which these things are happening.  I’m losing a bit of weight (because I’m never hungry), but I also have less energy due to that and that in and of itself causes other problems.

This really struck me the other day when I was stirring spaghetti (which I was making for my boyfriend).  It was nearly 10pm and I hadn’t eaten that day. I thought to myself “Why am I doing this? Because I want to have dinner with him.” But I didn’t really want dinner, I just wanted to be with him -- and realistically needed to eat something.  

Unhealthy food is also adding extra physical stress on top of the heavy duty stress I’ve already been under.  This is no good.  The final straw was that I travel a lot, and all of these set-pieces get even harder to manage when travelling.  

So I’m going in.  I’ve ordered two weeks worth of the Keto Fuel so that I can really try it out, and in two flavors (chocolate and cinnamon) so there’s some variety in there.  The current plan is to leave the option open for dinner every day, but replace meals with shakes the rest of the time.
